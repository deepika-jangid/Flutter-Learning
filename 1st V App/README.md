# 1st Version of My Flutter App
  Welcome Geeks again !! 
  <br>As I told you earlier, I will put all of my codes of Flutter Learning over here so that you guys can also learn from it and come up with new ideas on your own. So, here is         my second project of Flutter in which I will explain you about some of the concepts of flutter and will help you to make a small app using those concepts.  
  
<br><b>1. MaterialApp</b>- It is a widget which provides a screen(black in color) to run your app upon.

<br><b>2. Scaffold</b>- Scaffold Class is a widget which provides a white screen like a canvas to run your app.

<br><b>3. Appbar</b>- Scaffold class supports appBar through which you can create a appbar on the top of your app screen. In appBar, you can put Icons, IconButtons, Image, Text, etc. you want on positions like actions, leading, and so on according to your requirements.
<br><b>4. Body</b>
<br><b>5. Text</b>
<br><b>5. Image</b>
<br><b>6. Icon</b>
<br><b>7. IconButton</b>
