# 1st Version of My Flutter App
  Welcome Geeks again !! 
  <br>As I told you earlier, I will put all of my codes of Flutter Learning over here so that you guys can also learn from it and come up with new ideas on your own. So, here is         my second project of Flutter in which I will explain you about some of the concepts of flutter and will help you to make a small app using those concepts.  
  
<br><b>1. MaterialApp</b>- It is a widget which provides a screen(black in color) to run your app upon.
<br><b>2. Scaffold</b>- Scaffold Class is a widget which provides a white screen like a canvas to run your app.
<br><b>3. Appbar</b>- Scaffold class supports appBar through which you can create a appbar on the top of your app screen. In appBar, you can put Icons, IconButtons, Image, Text, etc. you want, on positions like actions, leading, and so on according to your requirements.
<br><b>4. Body</b>- The remaining part other than appBar is called as Body. You can put Text, Image, etc. on the body. But the challenge in the body is that it only supports one value i.e. you can only assign one value to the body like either text or image or something else but only one is allowed.
<br><b>5. Text</b>-  You can put whatever text you want to put in your app with different different styles, fonts, colors, sizes, etc.
<br><b>6. Image</b>- You can add images to your app by some folder, URL, etc.
<br><b>7. Icon</b> - Flutter provides pre-created icons, you just need to choose the name of icon which you want to use like email, profile, alarm, phone, etc. 
<br><b>8. IconButton</b>- By default the icon you created is not interactive. It is just a icon so to make it interactive like when we press it, something happens then we can go for IconButton which makes the icon as a button as well. And here you can put what you want to be happen when you will press the button.
